Each one should be a Python variable stored in the function for this endpoint, containing the string like this:\n","\n","```\n","first_list_item_text = \"About Me Page = /about\"\n","```\n","The index page should just display a list of the options of different urls for the user to navigate to.\n","\n","Here is a list of the pages and their requirements. \n","\n","**About Me /About** \n","\n","This page should contain an H1 tag at the top with your name, followed by an unordered list titled \"My Python Skills.\" You should list out the different Python skills you have here.\n","\n","Below that, include a ```<p>``` tag including a description of your professional experience and how you hope you can use Python in the future.\n","\n","**My Pandas Skills /PandasBasic**\n","\n","Add our gdpdata.csv file into your flask app by moving it under the same folder as your routes.py file. \n","\n","Display to a webpage using HTML the following from our raw data file:\n","\n","1. The top ten wealthiest countries in 1996\n","2. The year in which each of those countries had their maximum GDP\n","3. The average GDP for all countries in our dataset in 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010. Include the number of countries with valid GDP data in each year.\n","\n","**GDP Query Sample /GDPQuery**\n","\n","This page will be an opportunity to show your ability to tell the user about a country's GDP data based on dynamic input. The user should be able to input a country name in the url as a query parameter, and should get back:\n","\n","1. An H1 tag with the country the user entered\n","2. A list of their 5 highest years of GDP\n","3. A list with their 5 lowest years of GDP\n","4. Whether or not you want to travel to this country! (Think about how you may be able to store in python code the list of countries you want to travel to)\n","\n","**Professional Info API /professionalinfo**\n","\n","This endpoint should return JSON data to the browser including the following:\n","\n","1. Your full name\n","2. Your high school graduation year\n","3. Your employment history that you list on your resume\n","4. Your coding skills that you've learned in this course and beyond\n","5.
