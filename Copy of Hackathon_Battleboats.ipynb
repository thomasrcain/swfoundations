In other words, each boat will **only occupy a single space**, instead of the traditional ruleset where a boat may occupy many spaces in a row.\n","\n","As I'm sure you can guess, this will be a **complex problem** to solve. When faced with complex problems, the solution is to break them down into smaller parts, and tackle them individually, which is exactly what we're going to do."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Mi1llHUveVhE"},"source":["## Reminder about Colab Projects\n","\n","Remember that Google Colab has a Python environment constantly running in the background.

Setting up the Boards\n","\n","Before we talk Python, let's talk Battle Ships. What is the _purpose_ of the board - in other words, what do we _use it for_?\n","\n","For the sake of our game, the board's purpose is to tell us **whether or not a boat is present at a given set of coordinates**. In other words, we care about whether an item (the coordinates) _exists_ within the board or not.\n","\n","You have two options for a data structure to use for this problem. The one you're likely more comfortable with is a **list**, and if you'd like to use a list, that will work just fine.\n","\n","It's worth noting that the other option is a bit more appropriate for this situation, but it was a footnote during our discussions, so we haven't really gotten our hands dirty with it yet. The data structure in question is known as a **set**, which is like a list that only cares about whether or not an item is the set or not.\n","\n","Either of these data structures work, so use your favorite for the following steps."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uzAgRVHweOdI"},"source":["### Testing the Waters\n","\n","_(Concepts used: Lists, Sets, Sequences)_\n","\n","So now that we know _why_ we need boards, and we've talked about _what_ data structures we could use to implement them, it's time to talk about the remaining pieces.\n","\n","* **Do we need to create _actual_ boats?**\n","No, we don't care about the boats at all for this problem. We only care about _where_ the boats are, which means we only need to store their _location_.\n","* **How will we store where boats are located?**\n","The location of boats on the boards will depend on the player. The Human player will input where they'd like those boats to go. The Computer player will randomly place their boats.\n","* **How will we tell if we hit a ship or not?**\n","When a player attempts to attack their opponent's board, we can use the `in` keyword to determine if the target location has a ship or not. This is because our list/set will have three coordinates in it that represent a boat being present at that location, and if the `in` keyword returns `True` for that position, we know we hit a boat.\n","* **What happens when a boat sinks?**\n","When you hit an opponent boat, they should have that position **removed** from their board.\n","* **How do you know when a player has lost?**\n","This is pretty easy: when their board has no more items! That means we sunk each position that contains a boat. Use the `len()` function to achieve this functionality.\n","\n","---\n","\n","It's time to actually test out what we want to create.\n","\n","Let's make a practice cell that does the following:\n","\n","* Creates an empty board\n","* Hard-codes a single position into the board\n"," * This position should be a **Tuple**, where the first value is the X position and the second value is the Y position.\n"," * Must be \"within bounds\".
